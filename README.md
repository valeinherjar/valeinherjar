## Hello! 

I'm fairly new to the developer scene having only worked with Python and MATLAB for my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and data analysis for consulting.
I've spent the last decade managing projects and teams for operational efficiency and management behavioral coaching.
I want to do the same for the software development world and have a keen interest in the development of AI and LLMs. 

I spend free time training AI models with prompt based error realignment and learning new code languages. Currently, I have proficieny in Python and I am learning C#.
I am looking for help to become an AI engineering manager with aspirations to develop teams and coach them into the best versions of themselves while actively contributing to the betterment of AI.

Feel free to reach out to me on GitHub or LinkedIn if there is anything I can help you with.
